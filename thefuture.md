There are no simple solutions to the existential threats posed by the agricultural crisis and climate crisis. These crises stem from humanity’s ecological, ethical, and social problems that disregard the living planet we share with other species.  Such fundamental problems require radical solutions. We have no predetermined, specific designs to promote or endorse. 

We do, however, have clear ideas about the general contours of the future we believe is both possible and necessary – necessary, that is, to assure a habitable Earth for future generations of our own species and for the other components and systems of our profoundly complex ecosphere. It is that very complexity, in fact, that lies at the foundation of our view of what a sustainable future must emphasize.

* **Nature as Measure.** For a time, “man as the measure of all things” had value. The future we plan to build will see humans seeing themselves as integrated with the rest of the natural world and sharing a “land ethic” of the sort Aldo Leopold urged. Good solutions will be those that accord with the realities of this natural world and that follow its patterns.

* **Green Technology.** Post-carbon, small-footprint, non-extractive, high-diversity technology developed with an overriding mandate of ecological protection.  However, we acknowledge that technology alone cannot solve a crisis that stems from humanity’s exploitative attitude towards our living planet.

* **Collective Effort.** Global crises require global conscience & cooperation.  International regimes, guided by eco-centric principles, provide the best means for achieving the extensive transformation necessary to solve the agriculture and climate crises. 

One of the Global Restoration Project’s visions for this future is territorially integrated operational networks, or “eco-states.”  The current framework of global governance around “nation states” creates national rivalries over natural resources and augurs against collective, collaborative arrangements.  Eco-states are cross-border entities, defined by ecological factors, with authority extending only to agroecological matters.  Eco-states represent a new system of global governance that embrace our vision of humanity as trustees of our living planet.  Our vision for eco-states and the corresponding Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity is detailed in our publications, particularly the 2019 book *Global Corporate Trust for Agroecological Integrity* and the 2020 book *Deep Agroecology and a New Homeric Epic.*
