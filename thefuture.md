We have no predetermined specific designs to promote or endorse.  We do, however, have clear ideas about the general contours of the future we believe is both possible and necessary – necessary, that is, in order to assure a habitable Earth for future generations of our own species and for the other components and systems of our profoundly complex ecosphere.  It is that very complexity, in fact, that lies at the foundation of our view of what a sustainable future must emphasize.  

* Nature as Measure.  For a time, “man as the measure of all things” had value.  The future we plan to build will see humans seeing themselves as integrated with the rest of the natural world and sharing a “land ethic” of the sort Aldo Leopold urged.  Good solutions will be those that accord with the realities of this natural world and that follow its patterns. 

* Post-carbon, small-footprint, non-extractive, high-diversity technology. 

* Global conscience & cooperation.
