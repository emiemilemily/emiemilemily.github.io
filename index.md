The establishment of the **Global Restoration Project** in 2020 - and in particular its initial location in Kansas - reflects several sources of inspiration: 
* Kansas has started taking **alternative-energy initiatives**, including a remarkably robust development of wind-generated energy.  Just over the past x year, y has happened.  Importantly, the Global Restoration project **opposes** all wind-gnerated energy that (i) intereres significantly with wildlife habitat, (ii) costs more (when externalities are captured) that it yields, and/or (iii) creates out-of-human-scale landscapes.  But to the extent that wind, solar, geo-thermal, or other energy initiatives offer valid alternatives to fossil-carbon-based energy, we support it. 
* **Technological innovation** abounds in Kansas, as evidenced by its aerospace and x industries.  Insert details here.  Notably, some such technology runs in the worng direction, and we reject the view that technology will provide some "silver bullet" to relieve this generation of humans of its responsbility to relieve this generation of humans of its responsibility to reverse environmental degradation and to restore natural system on a planetary scale.  Still, we support smart technologicla innovation that will allow for a localized, resilient, sustainable, human-scale reintegration of our own species into processes and relationships that make ours a living planet.
