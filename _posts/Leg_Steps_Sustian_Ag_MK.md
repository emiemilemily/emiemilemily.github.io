#### Inching Forward: Legislative Steps Toward Sustainable Agriculture in the United States
Author:  Mary Kate Workman

Conventional agriculture in the United States is harmful for the environment in that the primary crops produced are annual monocultures, which are planted and harvested in an extractive manner. Further, much of todayâ€™s conventional agriculture relies on pesticides for crops and antibiotics for livestock, resulting in chemical harm throughout entire ecosystems. While Congress has recognized the US is in need of more sustainable agriculture, the legislative steps taken may be too little too late. The following table addresses many of the legislative initiatives Congress has taken in the past forty years to promote and encourage sustainable agriculture in the US. However, following the table is a discussion on why these programs are likely an insufficient means for a mounting environmental crisis.  

**Table 1: Examples of Sustainable Agriculture Legislation/Grants in the US**
| Legislation | Year | Goals of Legislation |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Conservation Reserve Program | 1985 | [CRP](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-program/) is a land conservation program administered by FSA. In exchange for a yearly rental payment, farmers enrolled in the program agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality. 
| [Sustainable Agriculture Research & Agriculture Program](https://www.sare.org/) | 1988 | Federal funding for projects to advance agricultural innovation that promotes profitability, stewardship of the land, air and water, and quality of life for farmers, ranchers and their communities. Primary grant programs include research and education grants, professional development grants and producer grants.
|[Organic Food Production Act](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Organic%20Foods%20Production%20Act%20of%201990%20(OFPA).pdf) | 1990 | This program stablished uniform national standards for the production and handling of organic food. The Act authorized a new USDA National Organic Program (NOP) to set national standards for the production, handling, and processing of organically grown agricultural products. 
|[Enviornmental Quality Incentive Program](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/programs/financial/eqip/?cid=nrcs144p2_037436) | 1996 | EQUIP is a conservation program providing primarily cost-sharing assistance, but also technical and educational assistance, aimed at promoting production and environmental quality, and optimizing environmental benefits.
