Grasslands about on Earth, but humans have damaged them profoundly.  This paper - part of a book project focusing on the international legal regimes needed to strike an appropriate balance between the protection of grassland areas and their use for agricultural production - identifies where grasslands are located, what makes them distinct parts of our natural order, how they have been degraded, and why that matters.  

This is the first contribution to the Working Paper Series, an element of the Center for International Trade and Agriculture at the University of Kansas School of Law.
